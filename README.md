# Groundhog
Goundhog is a SOCKS5 compatible TCP tunnel which can dig under firewalls without a trace.

The design of the protocol is profoundly inspired [shadowsocks](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks), and some parts are identical to shadowsocks. The identity is expected since the target is to have a working protocol, then to amend base on shadowsocks.
